libqaccessibilityclient (0.6.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Upload to unstable.
  * Restore Qt 5 packages, to ensure to smoother switch for users of this
    library:
    - add back the libqaccessibilityclient-qt5-dev, and
      libqaccessibilityclient-qt5-0 binaries
    - perform two separate builds for Qt 5 and Qt 6 versions
  * Fix the 'acc' autopkgtest:
    - set -std=c++17 for the Qt 6 library, needed when using Qt 6
    - fix the path with headers of the Qt 6 library
    - add some hints to add & exclude include paths, so the Qt 6 headers are
      not used for the Qt 5 library, and viceversa.
  * Drop old breaks/replaces.
  * Stop shipping the README.md file in libqaccessibilityclient-qt5-dev,
    as it does not provide a lot of value.
